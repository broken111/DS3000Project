    "1. (2\\%) Describes and motivates a real-world problem where data science may provide helpful insights. This problem must consist of at least two key questions of interest and your description of the problem and questions should be easily understood by a casual reader. Citations to motivating sources are preferred where possible (e.g. news articles, published papers, etc. Do not use Wikipedia itself, but the links Wikipedia articles cite may be useful)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (2\\%) Explicity state source and load data (does not have to be clean) from data source:\n",
    "   * Data must include at least **2 numeric** (e.g. number of friends, height, gpa, temperature, etc.) and **1 categorical** (e.g. color, class, car type, etc.) features\n",
    "   * Data **MUST BE COLLECTED VIA PYTHON, EITHER WITH AN API OR VIA WEB SCRAPING**. You may **NOT** simply download a .csv file\n",
    "     * Once you have succesfully collected, curated, cleaned the data, you may save it as a .csv or .json in your GitHub repo and call that final data set when implementing the ML (i.e. you do not have to call the API/do the web scraping every time you want to use the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. (1\\%) Write a paragraph about how the data will be used to solve the problem and your two questions of interest. At this point of the semester, we haven't studied the machine learning methods yet, but you should have a general idea of what you can do with ML (predict numerical values, predict class labels, or characterize relationships between features). If you do not, ask a TA or the professor or do a little googling."

After groups are assigned, it is the group's responsibility to select one of the group members' projects to work on. A group may only work on one project. If the group is having difficulty choosing a project, they may discuss their options with the professor or the TA assigned to them (see below).\n",

The TA's role is to provide feedback on the direction of the project, help answer questions (both technical and philsophical), and to serve as a liaison between the group and the professor (though groups are encouraged to reach out to the professor directly). The TAs will **not** be performing any part of data collection, cleaning, or analysis for the group.\n",

    "Introduction When it comes to financial information, there is a lot of information available on each particular stock. These include the price that the stock is selling at that particular moment, and other numerical information such as the revenue, costs, and other aspects that create the price of the stock. Using this information, the first question I would like to answer would be if I could predict a companies stock price based on prior stock prices, and also see if I could predict the price of a stock based on other features of the company using supervised machine learning. The second question I would like to answer is to see if I can predict the downfall of a company based on prior years. Both of these questions are important as the first one will allow investors to know when a stock will be worth it to buy and when it is the right time to sell. THe second question will allow investors to know which stock is the best to sell of at this moment, and which stocks to short right now too.\n",

    "The above dataset is not entirely cleaned but in order to clean it I will figure out which columns are the most important and will only use that. Since these are a bunch of data for 5 years for each stock value, I can use that to train the model, to predict future revenues, stock prices, inventory, etc. I'm still unsure on what columns to use but once I figure it out, the data will be cleaned as well. To train it I will use the past couple years as the training model, and then use other financial data to figure out what metrics are influencing the price the most. This will be done through supervised machine learning. The second question can be also be done using machine learning training, and I would just need to use my business knowledge to figure out what aspects would be the first to be affected. I have learned a little bit of supervised machine learning through my DS2000 and DS2500 class, but I will brush up my knowledge using stackoverflow and other class resources."

    "When we originally started creating our model for this, we decided to use multiple regression as there are a lot of features that affect the price of a stock. However, when we did this with the features recievables turnover and payables turnover, the MSE was very high suggesting that and the r2 was in the negatives suggesting that it was not a good fit. Using our business knowledge, we then concluded that the book value of the company and in relation its stock should be a much higher predicter on the revenue of the stock as the book value takes into consideration every other value. When we did this the MSE was significantly lower and the r2 was also higher (this Machine Learning model is present above). \n",
    "\n",
    "We had also created a residuals plot to check for the assumption of independence. Since there is no clear pattern and all the values are surroundeding the x-axis, it suggests that this assumption has been met. With out r2 being really high, it suggests that our ML model is very good at predicting the data. With MSE, it is really high as well, but through the graph, it is evident that there isn't much error except for the couple of outliers and that is probably why the MSE is really high. When it comes to plotting the specific features with the residuals, it doesn't look like there is a clear pattern as well which is a good thing, but it would be better to understand and make sure that it fits the assumptions once we get rid of the outliers. That way, the data will be zoomed in and can then we could see what the data is actually doing. "

    "## 6. Conclusions and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Performance\n",
    "- Polynomial Regression achieves superior performance with MSE of 1951.36\n",
    "- Model explains 83.29% of variance in revenue per share\n",
    "- Better handles non-linear relationships in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights\n",
    "1. Feature Importance:\n",
    "   - Shareholders Equity Per Share is the strongest predictor\n",
    "   - Book Value per Share and Graham Number is moderate\n",
    "   - Cash Per Share and Invested Capital has lower practical importance than expected\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Distribution:\n",
    "   - Revenue per share is highly skewed\n",
    "   - Most companies cluster in lower ranges\n",
    "   - Few companies have very high revenue per share\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Limitations:\n",
    "   - Higher prediction errors for extreme values\n",
    "   - Assumes similar relationships across industries\n",
    "   - Limited by available financial metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. Consider industry-specific models for better accuracy\n",
    "2. Collect more data for companies with extreme values\n",
    "3. Investigate additional financial ratios\n",
    "4. Regular model retraining with new data"

    " - At least one plot/graph/table of the results from each method. Any figure should be explained in simple terms and easily interpretable on its own with appropriate labelling.\n",
    "5. **Discussion** (3.5\\%): interpret your results in the application context. Determine if you found solutions to your questions of interest and explain why/why not. Critique your results; should they be accepted at face value or were some assumptions made inappropriate? What actions should be taken (if any) as a result of the analysis, and how confident are you in these actions? What questions that were unanticipated arose from the analysis, and what should future work/analyses focus on? *Highlight limitations of study*\n",
